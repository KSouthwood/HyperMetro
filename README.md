# [HyperMetro](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120)

## About

Have you ever been worried about getting lost in the subway? Do you need to
find a faster route to your destination? Write an application that will help
you better navigate the complicated metro system.

## Learning Outcomes

You will gain a better understanding of algorithms and data structures such
as doubly linked list and graphs.

### Stage 1: [One-line metro](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/648/implement)

#### _With the help of a singly-linked list, make a representation of a simple one-line metro system._

Text

### Stage 2: [Several directions](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/649/implement)

#### _Each line goes both ways: reflect two directions in your program and add a second metro line._

Text

### Stage 3: [A real metro](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/650/implement)

#### _Summary_

Text

### Stage 4: [The shortest route](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/651/implement)

#### _Add the ability to find the shortest route from the passenger's location to their destination._

Text

### Stage 5: [The fastest route](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/652/implement)

#### _Using a weighted graph, add the ability to calculate the estimated travel time._

Text

### Stage 6: [Branching](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120/stages/653/implement)

#### _Update your program to fit any kind of metro system, even the most complex ones._
